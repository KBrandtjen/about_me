      <p>Hello everyone, my name is Keith. This page is an opportunity for you to get to know me. I don't want to give away too much since you will be answering some questions about me but I'll hit some of the bullet points. I was born in Salem, OR and have lived in the northwest my entire life. I have played sports since I was a young child. My other hobbies include fly-fishing, cooking/eating, T.V., comedy and snowboarding. I attended Oregon State University in Corvallis, OR before moving to Seattle. I have lived in Seattle for two years. I am new to coding but am really excited about learning more and the opportunities it will open.</p>
